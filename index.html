        <div id="pod_description"> I have been creating podcasts that cover a variety of topics since 
            high school. This summer I was able to further develop my skills when I recorded and edited two
            shows, one interview-based and one news-based. 
            On the left is one I produced to introduce users to the CEO of the company.

            I have been creating video content since middle school. While I do not have the same amount of
            professional experience with video work, I do have a lot of experience creating personal projects
            as well as extensive academic work. On the left is a short piece I did for a multimedia journalism class
            project.
